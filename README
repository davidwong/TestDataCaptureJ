TestDataCaptureJ

A Java development tool for capturing test data when a Java application is run, to use in unit testing.


Description:
------------

When running a Java (web) application, uses AOP to log the contents of parameters or return values of
methods in the running application that you want to test. The contents of these objects are logged in
a format that can be used to create mock objects that can be used in unit testing (i.e. with JUnit, TestNG, etc).

Change Log:
-----------

* Version 0.9

This is the initial working release version.

* Version 1.0

This version is an update to use the lastest version of Java and tools. Also some refactoring and tidying up of the code in preparation for an internal re-write to make it more flexible.

- update to latest version of development tools and libraries (except where dependencies required old version):
  * Java 1.7
  * Eclipse Java IDE Juno 4.2
  * AJDT 2.2.1 (includes AspectJ 1.7.2)
  * 3rd party dependency jars in the lib directory
  
- refactor the classes that generate the text output in Java syntax (more meaningful file and package names, classes now created from a factory).

- fix broken unit tests
