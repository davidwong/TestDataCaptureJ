TestDataCaptureJ

A Java development tool for capturing test data when a Java application is run, to use in unit testing.


Description:
------------

When running a Java (web) application, uses AOP to log the contents of parameters or return values of
methods in the running application that you want to test. The contents of these objects are logged in
a format that can be used to create mock objects that can be used in unit testing (i.e. with JUnit, TestNG, etc).


See the 'doc' folder for further documentation.

The TODO list is currently in the TODO file.

Due to major refactoring, some of the unit tests have been broken (sorry), this is in the TODO list!
