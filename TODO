TODO list

Codebase:
---------

- how to handle logging fields without setters, or setters that don't follow javabean naming convention
options:
1. don't generate logging for those fields
2. generate as comment, so at least have value in the log for manual editing
3. generate reflection code to set field directly

- how to handle non default field assignments
e.g. 'Map map = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap())' instead of 'Map map = new Map()'
'List list = Arrays.asList(..)' instead of 'List list = new ArrayList()'
(possibly some configurable filtering, e.g. for a particular field in a particular class - have
a properties file for doing substitutions and configure in xml files)

- log formatting code is mixed up with the logging code (to make the logged output more readable), should
try to refactor it out and maybe do any formatting as a post-processing step or even not bother and let
eclipse or another tool do the formatting afterwards

- check that a parameterized constructor that is configured in xml files actually exists in the class

- add error/warning messages to ObjectInfo, with option to display as comments

- fix field name numbering so each class has it's own index (using map to store indices), at the moment
the index is on the type (e.g. object or collection or array or map)

- all class names in the log are fully qualified, the logging may be more readable if import statements
were generated (e.g. each class name is stored in a Set, and then import statements are generated
at the end)

- eliminate need for a dummy pointcut in aop.xml when we only want either a parameter or a return value, but
not both

- make the algorithm that generates methods names in the log configurable 
e.g. public au.com.dw.testdatacapturej.mock.explanation.Customer createParam1Customer_au_com_dw_testdatacapturej_explanation_ExplanationTest_joinPointParamForCustomer() {

- doesn't currently handle static fields, should it?

- make the index numbers used to suffix generated field names based on the class, instead of the categories of
object, collection, array and map


Unit Tests:
----------

- many of the unit tests are very brittle because they compare the logged output against specific
text
i.e.
Can break if the format of the logging changes (e.g. spacing and new lines, comments added, order
of elements in collections, etc)
Can break if configuration in xml files or property files change
options to fix:
1. strip out formatting (new line breaks) before comparison
2. being able to query the configuration to decide what the result should look like, e.g. whether
comments are present or if setters are generated for null fields

- probably need more detailed comments about what the tests are doing and the purpose of the mock
test objects and also about configuring the test aspects

- change all assert tests on logged output to use assertEqualsWithoutFormatting() instead of
assertEquals()
