    <title>Creating the Unit Test</title>

    <para>It is assumed that you have already setup the test application as a Java project in whatever development
    environment that you build and test it with. If not, then you will need to do so, e.g. setup the test application
    as a Java project using it's source code or with the test application jars that you want to test, as well as their
    dependencies. Basically this project needs to be setup so that you can run some unit tests against the test application
    code that you generated the test data for.</para>

  <para>Of course, for this very simple example using TestDataCaptureJ is overkill, but imagine if the generated test data was hundreds of lines of code ...</para>
